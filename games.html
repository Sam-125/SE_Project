      <h2>Portal 2</h2>
      <p>
        No game accomplishes so much so well. It has impeccable level design, charming personality, and exceptional and varied puzzle systems that will make you feel smarter just for getting through it. Plus, its co-op campaign requires a different
        sort of smarts that remains one of the best multiplayer experiences with pals around.

      <h2>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h2>
      <p>
        Deep, lengthy RPGs are a staple of PC gaming, and very few have put a larger chunk of sophisticated content forward than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has. Its massive sandbox open-world areas impress, both in terms of scope and density; they’re
        generously dotted with great monsters to slay, tantalizing mysteries to solve, and personal stories to unfurl.

      <h2>Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition</h2>
      <p>
        Divinity: Original Sin 2’s Definitive Edition has cemented it as one of the greatest RPGs of all time. It masterfully mixes pieces of classic cRPGs with more modern mechanics and designs, feeling old and new at the same time. The sequel has
        improved upon its predecessor's already incredible combat by deepening its systems while simultaneously simplifying and smoothing out its clunkier bits.

      <h2>Apex Legends</h2>
      <p>
        As the battle royale genre grew and evolved, Apex Legends developer Respawn was clearly watching. Its take on the hugely popular mode improves upon standard battle royale mechanics to make this shooter one of the best – if not the best – in
        the growing arena. As with all battle royale games, Apex Legends challenges you to be the last squad standing on its singular map as a wall of energy forces players closer together.

      <h2>Monster Hunter: World</h2>
      <p>
        Monster: Hunter World is a new chapter for the series, and its innovations and changes have made a traditionally difficult to get into game significantly more accessible. Killing giant dinosaurs and mounting ice and fire breathing dragons is
        a thrill few other games deliver in such spectacular fashion, and it’s all made even more fun when you coordinate your kills with up to three friends.

      <h2>Dead Cells</h2>
      <p>
        Dead Cells offers flexibility in a way few games do. Each easily digestible run through its beautifully detailed and shifting levels goads you to push the limits of your ability, and crushes you when you get too comfortable. Each easily
        digestible run through its beautifully detailed and shifting levels instills a feeling of discovery and familiarity.

      <h2>Warframe</h2>
      <p>
        It’s an often overlooked co-op action game that can quickly be summed up as “space ninjas,” and t’s undoubtedly grown past that moniker over the years. You can dash through space ships at breakneck speeds, smash and shoot enemies with dozens
        of varied weapons, fly over and explore large open world areas, and more recently even follow a story line that’s surprisingly engaging compared to where Warframe started.

      <h2>Fortnite Battle Royale</h2>
      <p>
        Fortnite’s Battle Royale quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, but its fast and frequent updates have shown it’s more than just a flash in the pan. Its free-to-play format and relatively simple shooting mechanics make it a significantly more
        accessible take on the battle royale shooter. But that’s coupled with unique building tools that push its skill cap sky high.

      <h2>Celeste</h2>
      <p>
        Celeste’s 2D platforming levels are as challenging to figure out as they are satisfying to complete. Hidden throughout those levels are a wealth of secrets, some of which push the skills it teaches you to the absolute limit. But its greatest
        triumph is how it blends that platforming with a sincere story and an incredible soundtrack that make it a genuinely impactful game too.

      <h2>Resident Evil 2</h2>
      <p>
        Resident Evil 2 has set the bar impossibly high for remakes and remasters of classic games by reimagining the 1998 original. But more importantly, it’s become the gold standard of survival horror. The derelict corridors of the Racoon
        City Police Department are brimming with both tension and action, which is a difficult balance to achieve in and of itself, but is just the beginning of Resident Evil 2’s triumphs.

      <h2>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</h2>
      <p>
        Assassin’s Creed Odyssey picks up (mechanically) where Origins left off, continuing the series’ evolution from stealth-sandbox to action/RPG. Taking place roughly 400 years before the events of AC Origins, Odyssey’s rendition of Ancient Greece is as gorgeous as the series (or games in general, quite frankly) has ever been. Traversing its verdant forests and rocky hills or sailing shining seas of the Mediterranean always offers something new to find or an ancient ruin to explore, and its combat is equal parts arcadey fun and ARPG-style strategy.

      <h2>Hollow Knight</h2>
      <p>
        Hollow Knight is one of the best modern Metroidvania’s around. It’s beautiful, expansive, and full of delightful secrets to discover that will keep you playing for dozens of hours. The kingdom of Hallownest is a brutal one, and Hollow Knight doesn’t ease you into it, causing a lot of people to bounce off of it initially – but when it finally gets its hooks in you it’s irresistibly hard to put down. Its sprawling caves open up and offer multiple paths to you at any given time, but no matter which way you go there are exciting bosses to fight and significant power-ups to make you stronger.
