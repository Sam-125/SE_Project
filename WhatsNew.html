      <h2>Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster</h2>
      <p>
        FINAL FANTASY VI is a game that's beloved by fans and critics alike. That's partly thanks to its incredible setting and story. It's set in a land where magic has disappeared, and humanity has instead turned to iron, gunpowder, steam and other
        technology. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that magic is mostly gone - a young woman enslaved by the evil Empire still has the power.

      <h2>Total War: WARHAMMER III</h2>
      <p>
        Far beyond the world and its petty wars there exists a dimension of pure, malevolent magic: The Realm of Chaos. It is a terrible place, incomprehensible to the mortal mind. It whispers promises of power, but to behold it is to be seduced by it. To relinquish your soul to it. To become it. The four Ruinous Powers rule over this place, ever seeking to slip their bonds and engulf the world in a tide of daemonic corruption. Nurgle, the plague god; Slaanesh, the lord of excess; Tzeentch, the changer of ways; and Khorne, the god of blood and slaughter.
